# POLICY EVALUATION

## AIM
To develop a Python program to evaluate the given policy.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The bandit slippery walk problem is a reinforcement learning problem in which an agent must learn to navigate a 7-state environment in order to reach a goal state. The environment is slippery, so the agent has a chance of moving in the opposite direction of the action it takes.
## States
The environment has 7 states:

1.    Two Terminal States: G: The goal state & H: A hole state.
2.    Five Transition states / Non-terminal States including S: The starting state.
## Actions
The agent can take two actions:

1.    R: Move right.
2.    L: Move left.
## Transition Probabilities
The transition probabilities for each action are as follows:

1.    50% chance that the agent moves in the intended direction.
2.    33.33% chance that the agent stays in its current state.
3.    16.66% chance that the agent moves in the opposite direction.

For example, if the agent is in state S and takes the "R" action, then there is a 50% chance that it will move to state 4, a 33.33% chance that it will stay in state S, and a 16.66% chance that it will move to state 2.
## Rewards
The agent receives a reward of +1 for reaching the goal state (G). The agent receives a reward of 0 for all other states.
